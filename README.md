# Siamese Network Embeddings for Brain Region Ranking in MRI Twin Identification via Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation

This study validates deep learning approaches for computational genetic similarity detection in brain MRI using Siamese networks with 3D CNN backbones. Using 138 genetically verified monozygotic twin pairs (276 subjects) from the Human Connectome Project S1200 dataset, we develop a data-driven framework for ranking neuroanatomical regions by their collective discriminative importance for genetic relatedness detection. Modified U-Net, ResNet, and DenseNet architectures generate 128-dimensional embeddings optimized via triplet loss with hard negative mining, achieving robust performance with U-Net demonstrating 92.0% F1-score and 95.2% AUC-ROC for automated twin identification. Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation analysis reveals pronounced subcortical dominance in discriminative importance, with statistical analysis confirming significantly higher mean importance for subcortical versus cortical regions (Cohenâ€™s d = 2.80, p = 3.89e-6): Thalamus (0.955), Brainstem (0.875), and Hypothalamus (0.707) leading rankings. This computational hierarchy contrasts with traditional ACE heritability studies that report highest heritability in cortical areas, demonstrating that direct pattern recognition from MRI data identifies different neuroanatomical signatures than statistical variance decomposition. The framework provides novel insights into which brain regions collectively enable genetic similarity detection, offering methodological advances for precision neuroimaging applications.
